Feature: before_playback hook

  The `before_playback` hook is called before a cassette sets up its
  stubs for playback.

  Your block should accept up to 2 arguments.  The first argument will be
  the HTTP interaction that is about to be used for play back.  The second
  argument will be the current cassette.

  You can also call `#ignore!` on the HTTP interaction to prevent VCR
  from playing it back.

  If you don't your hook to apply to all cassettes, you can use tags for
  this purpose.  Consider this code:

      VCR.configure do |c|
        c.before_playback(:twitter) { ... } # modify the interactions somehow
      end

      VCR.use_cassette('cassette_1', :tag => :twitter) { ... }
      VCR.use_cassette('cassette_2') { ... }

  In this example, the hook would apply to the first cassette but not the
  second cassette.

Feature: :new_episodes

  The `:new_episodes` record mode will:

    - Record new interactions.
    - Replay previously recorded interactions.

  It is similar to the `:once` record mode, but will _always_ record new
  interactions, even if you have an existing recorded one that is similar
  (but not identical, based on the `:match_request_on` option).

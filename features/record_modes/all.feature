Feature: :all

  The `:all` record mode will:

    - Record new interactions.
    - Never replay previously recorded interactions.

  This can be temporarily used to force VCR to re-record
  a cassette (i.e. to ensure the responses are not out of date)
  or can be used when you simply want to log all HTTP requests.

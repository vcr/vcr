Feature: :once

  The `:once` record mode will:

    - Replay previously recorded interactions.
    - Record new interactions if there is no cassette file.
    - Cause an error to be raised for new requests if there is a cassette file.

  It is similar to the `:new_episodes` record mode, but will prevent new,
  unexpected requests from being made (i.e. because the request URI changed
  or whatever).

  `:once` is the default record mode, used when you do not set one.

Feature: Cucumber with Scenario Outline

  vcr :use_scenario_name works with Scenario Outlines

      Feature: VCR example

        Note: Cucumber treats the pre-amble as part of the feature name. When
        using the :use_scenario_name option, VCR will only use the first line
        of the feature name as the directory for the cassette.

          When a request is made to "http://localhost:7777/localhost_request_1"

    And the directory "features/cassettes" does not exist

    Then it should pass with "1 scenario (1 passed)"
    And the file "features/cassettes/VCR_example/scenario_outline/_foo_bar_.yml" should contain "Hello localhost_request_1"

    # Run again without the server; we'll get the same responses because VCR
    # will replay the recorded responses.

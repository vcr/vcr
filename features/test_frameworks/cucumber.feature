Feature: Usage with Cucumber

  VCR can be used with cucumber in two basic ways:

    - Use `VCR.use_cassette` in a step definition.
    - Use a `VCR.cucumber_tags` block to tell VCR to use a
      cassette for a tagged scenario.

  In a cucumber support file (e.g. features/support/vcr.rb), put code like this:

  ``` ruby
  VCR.cucumber_tags do |t|
    t.tag  '@tag1'
    t.tags '@tag2', '@tag3'

    t.tag  '@tag3', :cassette => :options
    t.tags '@tag4', '@tag5', :cassette => :options
    t.tag  '@vcr', :use_scenario_name => true
  end
  ```

  VCR will use a cassette named `cucumber_tags/<tag_name>` for scenarios
  with each of these tags (Unless the `:use_scenario_name` option is provided. See below).
  The configured `default_cassette_options` will be used, or you can override specific
  options by passing a hash as the last argument to `#tag` or `#tags`.

  You can also have VCR name your cassettes automatically according to the feature
  and scenario name by providing `:use_scenario_name => true` to `#tag` or `#tags`.
  In this case, the cassette will be named `<feature_name>/<scenario_name>`.
  For scenario outlines, VCR will record one cassette per row, and the cassettes
  will be named `<feature_name>/<scenario_name>/<row_name>`.

      Feature: VCR example

        Note: Cucumber treats the pre-amble as part of the feature name. When
        using the :use_scenario_name option, VCR will only use the first line
        of the feature name as the directory for the cassette.

        @localhost_request
        Scenario: tagged scenario
          When a request is made to "http://localhost:7777/localhost_request_1"

          When a request is made to "http://localhost:7777/nested_cassette" within a cassette named "nested_cassette"
          Then the response should be "Hello nested_cassette"
          When a request is made to "http://localhost:7777/localhost_request_2"
          Then the response should be "Hello localhost_request_2"

        @vcr
        Scenario: tagged scenario

        Note: Like the feature pre-amble, Cucumber treats the scenario pre-amble
        as part of the scenario name. When using the :use_scenario_name option,
        VCR will only use the first line of the feature name as the directory
        for the cassette.

          When a request is made to "http://localhost:7777/localhost_request_1"
          Then the response should be "Hello localhost_request_1"

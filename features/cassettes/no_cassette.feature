Feature: Error for HTTP request made when no cassette is in use

  VCR is designed to help you remove all HTTP dependencies from your
  test suite.  To assist with this, VCR will cause an exception to be
  raised when an HTTP request is made while there is no cassette in
  use.  The error is helpful to pinpoint where HTTP requests are
  made so you can use a VCR cassette at that point in your code.

  If you want to allow an HTTP request to proceed as normal, you can
  set the `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` configuration option
  (see configuration/allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette.feature) or
  you can temporarily turn VCR off:

    - `VCR.turn_off!` => turn VCR off so HTTP requests are allowed
    - `VCR.turn_off!(:disable_cassette_errors => true)` => turn
      VCR off and ignore cassette errors
    - `VCR.turn_on!` => turn VCR back on
    - `VCR.turned_off { ... }` => turn VCR off for the duration of the
      provided block.

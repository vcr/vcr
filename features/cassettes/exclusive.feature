Feature: exclusive cassette

  VCR allows cassettes to be nested. This is particularly useful in
  a context like cucumber, where you may be using a cassette for an
  entire scenario, and also using a cassette within a particular step
  definition.

  By default, both the inner and outer cassettes are active. On each
  request, VCR will look for a matching HTTP interaction in the inner
  cassette, and it will use the outer cassette as a fall back if none
  can be found.

  If you do not want the HTTP interactions of the outer cassette considered,
  you can pass the `:exclusive` option, so that the inner cassette is
  used exclusively.

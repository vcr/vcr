Feature: Automatic Re-recording

  Over time, your cassettes may get out-of-date. APIs change and sites you
  scrape get updated. VCR provides a facility to automatically re-record your
  cassettes. Enable re-recording using the `:re_record_interval` option.

  The value provided should be an interval (expressed in seconds) that
  determines how often VCR will re-record the cassette.  When a cassette
  is used, VCR checks the earliest `recorded_at` timestamp in the cassette;
  if more time than the interval has passed since that timestamp,
  VCR will use the `:all` record mode to cause it be re-recorded.

  Background:
    Given a previously recorded cassette file "cassettes/example.yml" with:
      """

      http_interactions: 
      - request:

  Scenario: Cassette is not re-recorded when not enough time has passed
    Given it is Tue, 07 Nov 2011
    When I run `ruby re_record.rb`
    Then the output should contain "Old Response"
    But the output should not contain "New Response"
    And the file "cassettes/example.yml" should contain "Old Response"
    But the file "cassettes/example.yml" should not contain "New Response"

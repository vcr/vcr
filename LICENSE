to deal in the Software without restriction, including without
limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to
permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to
the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this License or a subsequent version
published on the Hippocratic License Website
(https://firstdonoharm.dev/) shall be included in all copies or
substantial portions of the Software. Licensee has the option of
following the terms and conditions either of the above numbered
version of this License or of any subsequent version published on the
Hippocratic License Website.

Compliance with Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles:

1. Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or
entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any
applicable laws, regulations, or rules that protect human, civil,
labor, privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due
process, or similar rights (the "Human Rights Laws"). Where the Human
Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable to the use
of the Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of
the individuals or groups harmed shall apply.

2. Human Rights Principles. Licensee is advised to consult the
articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and the
United Nations Global Compact
(https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles) that
define recognized principles of international human rights (the
"Human Rights Principles"). It is Licensor's express intent that all
use of the Software be consistent with Human Rights Principles. If
Licensor receives notification or otherwise learns of an alleged
violation of any Human Rights Principles relating to Licensee's use
of the Software, Licensor may in its discretion and without
obligation (i) (a) notify Licensee of such allegation and (b) allow
Licensee 90 days from notification under (i)(a) to investigate and
respond to Licensor regarding the allegation and (ii) (a) after the
earlier of 90 days from notification under (i)(a), or Licensee's
response under (i)(b), notify Licensee of License termination and (b)
allow Licensee an additional 90 days from notification under (ii)(a)
to cease use of the Software.

3. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor
against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims,
actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines,
costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor's reasonable
attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee's
non-compliance with this License or use of the Software in violation
of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles. 

Enforceability: If any portion or provision of this License is
determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision
in any other jurisdiction. Upon a determination that any term or
provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the court may modify this License to
affect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible. The
section headings are for convenience only and are not intended to
affect the construction or interpretation of this License. Any rule
of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not apply in interpreting this
License. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its
fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.

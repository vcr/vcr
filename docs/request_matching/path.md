# Matching on Path

Use the `:path` request matcher to match requests on the path portion
  of the request URI.

  You can use this (alone, or in combination with `:host`) as an
  alternative to `:uri` so that non-deterministic portions of the URI
  are not considered as part of the request matching.

## Background

_Given_ a previously recorded cassette file "cassettes/example.yml" with:

```yaml
--- 
http_interactions: 
- request: 
    method: post
    uri: http://host1.com/about?date=2011-09-01
    body: 
      encoding: UTF-8
      string: ""
    headers: {}
  response: 
    status: 
      code: 200
      message: OK
    headers: 
      Content-Length: 
      - "14"
    body: 
      encoding: UTF-8
      string: about response
    http_version: "1.1"
  recorded_at: Tue, 01 Nov 2011 04:58:44 GMT
- request: 
    method: post
    uri: http://host2.com/home?date=2011-09-01
    body: 
      encoding: UTF-8
      string: ""
    headers: {}
  response: 
    status: 
      code: 200
      message: OK
    headers: 
      Content-Length: 
      - "15"
    body: 
      encoding: UTF-8
      string: home response
    http_version: "1.1"
  recorded_at: Tue, 01 Nov 2011 04:58:44 GMT
recorded_with: VCR 2.0.0
```

## Replay interaction that matches the path

_And_ a file named "path_matching.rb" with:

```ruby
include_http_adapter_for("<http_lib>")

require 'vcr'

VCR.configure do |c|
  <configuration>
  c.cassette_library_dir = 'cassettes'
end

VCR.use_cassette('example', :match_requests_on => [:path]) do
  puts "Response for /home: " + response_body_for(:get, "http://example.com/home")
end

VCR.use_cassette('example', :match_requests_on => [:path]) do
  puts "Response for /about: " + response_body_for(:get,  "http://example.com/about")
end
```

_When_ I run `ruby path_matching.rb`

_Then_ it should pass with:

```
Response for /home: home response
Response for /about: about response
```
